# Utility Functions

The `@browser-ext/utils` package provides a set of utility functions to help with common browser extension development tasks.

## sleep

A utility function that creates a promise that resolves after a specified time. Useful for adding delays in async operations.

```typescript
import { sleep } from '@browser-ext/utils';

// Wait for 1 second
await sleep(1000);
```

## waitForSelector

Waits for an element matching a CSS selector to appear in the DOM. Returns a promise that resolves with the element or null if the timeout is reached.

```typescript
import { waitForSelector } from '@browser-ext/utils';

// Basic usage
const element = await waitForSelector<HTMLDivElement>('.my-class');

// With a container element
const container = document.querySelector('.container');
const element = await waitForSelector<HTMLDivElement>('.my-class', container);

// With a timeout
const element = await waitForSelector<HTMLDivElement>('.my-class', undefined, 5000);
```

### Parameters

- `selector`: The CSS selector to match
- `container` (optional): The container element to search within
- `maxWait` (optional): Maximum time to wait in milliseconds

### Returns

- Returns the element immediately if found
- Returns a promise that resolves with:
  - The element when found
  - `null` if the maxWait timeout is reached

## waitForSelectorAll

Similar to `waitForSelector`, but waits for all elements matching a CSS selector. Returns a promise that resolves with an array of elements.

```typescript
import { waitForSelectorAll } from '@browser-ext/utils';

// Basic usage
const elements = await waitForSelectorAll<HTMLDivElement>('.my-class');

// With a container element
const container = document.querySelector('.container');
const elements = await waitForSelectorAll<HTMLDivElement>('.my-class', container);

// With a timeout
const elements = await waitForSelectorAll<HTMLDivElement>('.my-class', undefined, 5000);
```

### Parameters

- `selector`: The CSS selector to match
- `container` (optional): The container element to search within
- `maxWait` (optional): Maximum time to wait in milliseconds

### Returns

- Returns an array of elements immediately if found
- Returns a promise that resolves with:
  - An array of elements when found
  - An empty array if the maxWait timeout is reached

## Implementation Details

Both `waitForSelector` and `waitForSelectorAll` use the MutationObserver API to efficiently watch for DOM changes. They:

- Check immediately if the element(s) exist
- If not found, observe DOM changes until:
  - The element(s) are found
  - The optional timeout is reached
- Automatically clean up the observer when done

This makes them ideal for extension content scripts where you need to wait for elements to appear on the page.
