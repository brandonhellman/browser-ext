# Getting Started

@browser-ext is the easiest way to create browser extensions with no build configuration.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx @browser-ext/create my-extension
cd my-extension
npm run dev
```

Then load the extension in your browser to see your extension in action.

When you're ready to deploy to production, run `npm run build` to create a production build.

### Get Started Immediately

You don't need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel. They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Just create a project, and you're good to go.
